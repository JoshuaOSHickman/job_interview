Programmer job interviews can be annoying. And sometimes the questions require you to actually think. With Job Interview, most programming interview questions can be answered in 3 lines of Ruby.\r\n\r\nYou can view the slides from our RailsConf 2012 lightning talk about job_interview [here](http://ruby-jokes.github.com/job_interview/pres.html).\r\n\r\n## USAGE\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nrequire 'job_interview'\r\n@answer = JobInterview::Answer.new\r\n\r\n# FizzBuzz\r\n@answer.fizz_buzz(5)\r\n => [1, 2, \"Fizz\", 4, \"Buzz\"]\r\n\r\n# Fibonacci numbers (default: recursive strategy)\r\n@answer.fib(10)\r\n => [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]\r\n \r\n# Fibonacci numbers (iterative strategy)\r\n@answer.fib(10, :iterative)\r\n => [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]\r\n \r\n# Fibonacci numbers (using matrices)\r\n@answer.fib(10, :matrix)\r\n => [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]\r\n\r\n# Quine\r\n@answer.quine(__FILE__)\r\n => \"@answer.quine(__FILE__)\"\r\n\r\n# The first n primes\r\n@answer.primes(10)\r\n => [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]\r\n \r\n# Hello, World!\r\n@answer.hello_world\r\n => \"Hello, World!\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, job_interview will help you answer non-technical interview questions as well! Simply call the appropriate method, and a randomly constructed answer will pop out.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ninclude JobInterview::Questions\r\n```\r\n\r\nQ. Where do you see yourself in five years?\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nin_5_years\r\n\r\n => \"I'd like to have made someone else rich with my re-contextualized non-volatile open architecture.\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you leaving your current position?\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nleaving_current\r\n\r\n => \"I'm seeking to optimize extensible applications.\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nQ.  Why are manhole covers round?\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nmanhole_cover\r\n\r\n => \"Because Reuleaux Triangles are hard to manufacture.\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nQ.  What is you greatest weakness?\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ngreatest_weakness\r\n\r\n => \"I always fail so rarely so I make too much money.\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nQ. Why do you want to work here?\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nwhy_here\r\n\r\n => \"Your company has revolutionized seamless next generation interface.\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nQ. Does P = NP?\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\np_equals_np\r\n\r\n => \"I doubt it, but it would make life easier for traveling salesmen.\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nQ. Please tell us, in a few words, about what interests you?\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nwhat_interest\r\n\r\n => \"I have a special interest in modular mobile startup platforms.\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\n\r\n  Q. Why would you even do this?\r\n\r\n  A. We wanted to hack on something trivial and silly at BohConf 2012. Also, most job interviews are dumb, and we felt the need to point this out.\r\n\r\n  Q. Do you expect this of be of any use to anyone, ever?\r\n\r\n  A. No.\r\n\r\n  Q. So what's next?\r\n\r\n  A. The Ruby implementation of job_interview is pretty decent at this point, we think. But maybe you're not applying for a Ruby job. So a Clojure implementation seems likely, possibly to be followed by JavaScript.\r\n\r\n## How do I get it?\r\n\r\n[At RubyGems, of course](http://rubygems.org/gems/job_interview)\r\n\r\n## AUTHORS\r\n\r\n[Micah Gates](https://github.com/mgates)\r\n\r\n[Jason Lewis](https://github.com/canweriotnow)\r\n\r\n## Contributions by:\r\n\r\n[intolerable](https://github.com/intolerable)\r\n\r\n[Joel Parker Henderson](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson)\r\n\r\nThe authors would also like to thank:\r\n\r\n- Carlos Le√≥n [@mongrelion](https://twitter.com/mongrelion)\r\n- [Faker](http://faker.rubyforge.org/), the funniest placeholder gem\r\n\r\n## CONTRIBUTING\r\n\r\nReally? You have that much time on your hands? Awesome!\r\n\r\nTwo guidelines, though:\r\n\r\n- Please include a test for any patches you submit. Job interviews are Serious Business, and we need to make sure the code is correct.\r\n- We're not that into adding more questions to `JobInterview::Questions`. So please don't target that module unless you're certain your patch is SUPER funny.\r\n\r\n## LICENSE\r\n\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2012 Micah Gates and Jason Lewis\r\n\r\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n(at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
