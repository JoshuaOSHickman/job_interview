# Job Interview

## SYNOPSIS

Let's face it. Programming job interviews can be annoying. And sometimes the questions require you to actually think. With Job Interview, most programming interview questions can be answered in 3 lines of Ruby.

## USAGE

    require 'job_interview'
    @answer = JobInterview::Answer.new
    
    @answer.fizz_buzz(5)
    
    => [1, 2, "Fizz", 4, "Buzz"]
    
    @answer.fib(10)
    
    => [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]
